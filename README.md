# Finance Management System using MERN stack

## Overview
This application is a simple yet powerful expense tracker that allows users to manage their budget effectively. Users can add income and expenses easily using a straightforward input method.

## How It Works
- **Adding Income**: Enter a positive amount (e.g., `1000`). This will be added to your total budget.
- **Adding Expense**: Enter a negative amount (e.g., `-500`). This will be deducted from your total budget and categorized as an expense.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive UI.
- Real-time budget calculation.
- Expense tracking with a single input.
- Accessible from anywhere via a web browser.
